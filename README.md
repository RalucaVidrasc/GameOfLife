# GameOfLife

  This project contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This game is a cellular automaton with zero players and it is played on a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each cell having two possible states: alive or dead. 
  The evolution is determined solely by the initial state of the cells and the rules of interaction between without further intervention from the players. Although the rules are simple, the complexity and diversity of emerging behaviors are surprising and fascinating.

  In this project I have added both CPU and GPU implementations, observing the behavior of each and the differences between these methods.
