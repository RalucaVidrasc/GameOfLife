# GameOfLife

  This project 
  Conway's Game of Life, invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway
in 1970, is a cellular automaton with zero players. This game is played on a grid
two-dimensional grid of square cells, each cell having two possible states: alive or dead. The evolution is determined solely by the initial state of the cells and the rules of interaction between without further intervention from the players. Although the rules are simple, the complexity and diversity of emerging behaviors are surprising and fascinating.
